## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

Initial public release.

pall8t runs AI coding agents inside [apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container)
sandboxes: a headless CLI that launches an agent in a macOS-native lightweight
VM, with the current directory mounted as the workspace and an isolated
container home.

### Added

- `pall8t init` — generate `~/.pall8t/home`, `.pall8t/config.toml` skeleton, and
  the default Containerfile.
- `pall8t run` — hash-check the Containerfile, rebuild if needed, then run the
  agent (default: `claude`) in the sandbox with TTY passthrough and signal
  forwarding; `-- <cmd>` overrides the configured command.
- `pall8t build` — explicit, unconditional image build.
- `pall8t ls [--json]` — list pall8t containers (`--json` for scripting, e.g.
  herdr).
- `pall8t exec <id> -- cmd` — run a command inside a running container.
- `pall8t stop <id>` — stop a container.
- `pall8t herdr doctor [--json]` — check herdr env/socket/binary reachability.
- Automatic image rebuilds driven by the Containerfile's content hash, with no
  resident watch daemon; superseded images are pruned automatically after a
  successful build.
- Persistent, shared container home (`~/.pall8t/home`) so agent login and
  config survive across runs and rebuilds without touching the host's
  `~/.claude`.
- Git worktree awareness: when cwd is a worktree, the main repository's `.git`
  is mounted alongside so `status`/`commit`/`diff` behave exactly as on the
  host.
- Reference-repo protection via `git clone --local` duplication — a workaround
  for apple/container's missing read-only mounts
  ([apple/container#990](https://github.com/apple/container/issues/990)).
- Two-layer TOML config (global `~/.pall8t/config.toml`, per-project
  `.pall8t/config.toml`, project wins per field) covering container
  resources, run command, and reference repos.
- herdr integration: `argv[0]` agent-name hinting (with lookthrough for
  launchers and Homebrew's `container` exec wrapper) so herdr's screen-content
  state detection works on the sandboxed agent; sidebar display-name
  reporting (`<agent> (pall8t)`); automatic skip of the tmux wrapper when
  already running inside a herdr pane.
- Home compositor isolated mode (`[home] mode = "isolated"`, **experimental**)
  for per-run home forks with harvest/promote/merge
  (`pall8t home inbox|show|promote|drop|merge`) and revision history/lifecycle
  management (`pall8t home log|diff|rollback|ls|rm|gc`); off by default in
  favor of the shared-home mode.
